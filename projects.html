                            implementing algorithms for autonomous navigation, object detection, and real-time mapping.

                            The project represented Jordan in the Minesweeper Robot Competition held in Egypt,
                            It later won Third Place in
                            the Jordan Design and Development Bureau’s (JODDB) Creative Excellence Initiative. As part
                            of the award, we developed an advanced second version funded by JODDB, which was showcased
                            at SOFEX 2024, integrating improved AI perception and control systems for enhanced
                            performance in real-world environments.</p>

                        <p>An underwater drone developed as part of the Orange Summer Challenge,
                            where participants built technology-driven startup ideas. Our
                            project aimed to tackle marine safety and ecosystem balance by integrating AI-based
                            dangerous object detection, specifically identifying lionfish
                            species.

                            The drone is powered by a Raspberry Pi and Pixhawk controller, featuring brushless motors,
                            LED lighting, and a live video feed system. it
                            enables real-time underwater monitoring, making it suitable for environmental research,
                            oceanography, and future commercial applications in marine exploration.</p>

                            and order processing with secure, scalable architecture.

                            The API was structured for smooth integration with both the LavaMart frontend and potential

                            missions — combining mechanical precision with reliable sensor-based control.

                            I contributed to the programming and control systems,

                            sessions, our effort was rewarded when the robot won Third Place in the Mechanical Design
                            category at the Firefighting Competition organized by Princess Sumaya University for

                        <p>An autonomous combat robot designed for Sumo-style robotics competitions, where two robots
                            face off to push each other out of the ring. The robot combines sensor-based opponent
                            detection with fast motor control and strategic movement algorithms for competitive
                            performance.

                            We participated in the competition three times, improving the robot’s design and performance
                            with each version — from refining the mechanical stability and grip to optimizing control
                            logic and decision-making speed. Every iteration brought new lessons in electronics, coding,
                            and teamwork, steadily evolving the robot into a more capable and adaptive contender.</p>
